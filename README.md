Our project idea is a backend API for a textbook-sharing application. Currently, PolyPDF (a Google spreadsheet) allows students to access free textbook PDFs for classes. In our project, we would turn this spreadsheet into a more formal database that stores the textbooks and additional information about them, like class, author, edition, etc. Users would be able to add new textbooks, search, and filter the database.
