Our project idea is a backend API for a textbook-sharing application. Currently, PolyPDF (a Google spreadsheet) allows students to access free textbook PDFs for classes. In our project, we would turn this spreadsheet into a more formal database that stores textbooks and additional information about them, such as author, edition, course number, professor, etc. Users will be able to query the database with their course number and professor or other attributes for a particular class and then receive a list of matching textbook links. Users would further be able to add a textbook link to the database in order to assist other students.
